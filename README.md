# CORONAVIRUS-A-PYTHON-MACHINE-LEARNING-SOLUTION
this project will let us know the "CORONAVIRUS PROBABILITY OF INFECTION"
this is a python , machine learning using logistic regression for finding the "INFECTION PROBABILITY " in a given data set .
so i have created a data set using excel randomised function and the coloums are : fever	,body_Pain,	age,	runny_Nose	,difficulty_in_Breathing	,infection_Probability . we can add more colums to the data but this is a basic approch . 
filling  the data using the randamised data set and finding the probality of infection in a group of let say 3000 peoples . 
we can caractorize that there are let 800 peoples having the probabilty more than 75% are can prioterise their checking 

Machine Learning model parameters:-
A team of doctors can sit down to find out the best model parameters.
A sample set of parameters is as follow:
Features:
Average Fever-Continous
Body Pain-0/1 Binary
Age-Discrete
Runny Nose
Breathing Problem- Categorical: 0/1/-1

and using bootstap and html for UI and flask modules
